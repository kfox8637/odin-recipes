    <h2>Rich and Creamy Alfredo Gnocchi Bake: A Heavenly Comfort Dish</h2>
    <p>
      Alfredo Gnocchi Bake is an indulgent and satisfying dish that combines
      soft, pillowy gnocchi with a rich, velvety Alfredo sauce, creating a
      comforting meal perfect for any occasion. The gnocchi, gently baked to a
      golden finish, absorbs the creamy sauce, infusing every bite with its
      decadent flavor. The sauce itself is made with butter, heavy cream,
      garlic, and Parmesan cheese, simmered together to create a luscious,
      smooth texture. The dish is often topped with a layer of melted mozzarella
      and Parmesan, which crisps up beautifully in the oven, adding both flavor
      and a delightful texture contrast.
