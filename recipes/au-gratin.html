    <h2>Creamy and Indulgent Au Gratin Potatoes: A Comfort Food Classic</h2>
    <p>
      Au gratin potatoes are a rich and creamy dish that combines thinly sliced
      potatoes with a luscious cheese sauce, creating a decadent side dish
      that’s perfect for any occasion. The potatoes are layered in a baking dish
      and smothered in a velvety sauce made with butter, cream, and a mix of
      flavorful cheeses like cheddar or Gruyère. Fresh garlic, onions, and a
      touch of seasoning bring the dish to life, enhancing the natural flavors
      of the potatoes. As it bakes, the cheese melts and forms a golden, crispy
      top, while the inside remains soft and tender, creating the perfect
      balance of textures.

    <p>
      What makes au gratin potatoes so irresistible is the richness of the sauce
      and the comforting, velvety consistency. The layers of cheese and potatoes
      meld together, absorbing the flavors as the dish bakes, making each bite
      more delicious than the last. Whether served alongside a roasted meat or
      as a standalone dish, au gratin potatoes offer a satisfying, indulgent
      experience that’s always a hit at dinner tables, holidays, and gatherings.
      With its combination of creamy, cheesy goodness and crispy golden top,
      it’s no wonder this dish has remained a favorite for so many years.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced into rings</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees
        C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish;
        season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer onion slices over top, then top with with remaining potatoes.
        Season again with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in
        flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has
        cooked off, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each
        addition to incorporate; the gradual addition and whisking of milk will
        help avoid lumps in your sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is
        bubbly, about 1 ½ hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
